# 11ntR_architecture
Code and data repository for PNAS submission "Dissecting the energetic architecture within an RNA tertiary structural motif via high-throughput thermodynamic measurements"

Materials are provied as-is. Jupyter notebooks were run using Python 3.8.12


Large data files are stored on a separate Box drive: https://stanford.box.com/s/1kvdsprla0hw98fbfxq1geqfw1g4wi3t
All files with a .gz extention will need to be unzipped (e.g. using gunzip). The contents of the folder can then be copied over into a local download of this repository to run the code blocks.
